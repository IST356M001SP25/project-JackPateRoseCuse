# About My Project

### What it does
The first code allows you to select 2 variables to find their correlation, while also displaying the team with the legend as well, while the second code allows you to find the correlation between a given stat and win-loss%, while still displaying the team name as well for each. 

### How you run my project
You go into streamlit and run streamlit, and it should give you the selectboxes for each of the stats you can choose, and then it should run on its own (with the base for each selectbox being "Tm"). 

### Other things you need to know
Nothing in particular its a pretty simple code for correlation finding (positive or negative).
