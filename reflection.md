## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

The hardest part of any project like this for me personally is always thinking of what I want to do with a dataset, because there are just so many options of what exactly to do. The dataset I chose to use is the MLB stats from sports reference, and that was an easier choice for me because I love sports and its a dream to work in the sports industry. For the code itself, loading the 3 datasets that I wanted to use was a pretty simple process, once I found the right link for each one, which was a little tougher than I expected, but once I found them, I knew how to load them. Remembering the exact workings of the merge function was not the easiest, but each dataset had the same name for the team column, which made it simpler to merge, as I did not have to do "merge on the left of" or "merge on the right of" for multiple columns with the same data, but I just forgot for a second exactly how to merge two dataframes successfully. Then creating the streamlit to allow for someone to find the correlation between two variables was somewhat difficult because of it needing to be in streamlit, and requiring more code to be written along with the scatterplot creation, and thus having to import matplotlib to allow me to choose the size of the graph, along with allowing me to have the legend for the plot as well, but have the legend be outside the graph. Once I remembered the longer form code for creating a streamlit seaborn file with matplotlib, the rest was easy, because it was just simply filling in info at each spot that I had created previously with the column names selectbox. 

If I had more time, I would like to make it to where you could click on or hover over each dot in the scatterplot to see the information about that dot, but I do not believe we learned how to do that in class for a scatterplot, and only learned that for a map, which does not apply directly to scatterplots, and I might also like to try to dig deeper into the information and create more columns in the dataset that would also be for analysis (for example, run differential for each team).
